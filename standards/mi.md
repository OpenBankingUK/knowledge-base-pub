### **What is meant by Online/Mobile Banking in MI reporting 3.1.2 specification?**

Online Banking covers both Desktop and Mobile browsers. Mobile Banking means only native mobile banking apps.

### **Which reporting template should ASPSPs use to report MI to FCA?**

ASPSPs must use REP020 Quarterly statistics on availability and performance of dedicated interfaces, available at https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/form/sup/SUP_16_ann_46A_20190914.pdf

ASPSPs may also find this reporting template (<a href="https://standards.openbanking.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Operational-Guidelines-ASPSP-Reporting-Template-v3.1.5.xlsx" class="external-link" rel="nofollow"> Operational Guidelines ASPSP Reporting Template v3.1.5</a>) useful in this regard.

### **Is the FCA reporting template same as the OBL MI reporting template?**

No. Please refer to relevant links for templates.

### **While reporting to FCA using the reporting template, should the ASPSP publish statistics for both website and mobile app separately?**

There are two important issues to note in this context:

1. **Publication on ASPSP Website:** The ASPSP must publish on its website, on a quarterly basis, details on availability and performance of their dedicated interface as well as, each of the interfaces made available to its own PSUs for directly accessing their payment accounts online. For example, if an ASPSP has a website and mobile app for consumer accounts and a separate website and mobile app for business accounts, they may need to report separately to cover each of the four PSU interfaces.

2. **FCA Reporting:** When submitting quarterly reports to the FCA, the report comprises of a baseline of the information published on the ASPSP website, with a breakdown which provides more granular details the specified parameters of individual endpoints.
