**What APIs can an AISP access?**

The Account and Transaction API Profile describes the flows and common functionality for the Accounts and Transaction API, which allows an Account Information Service Provider ('AISP') to:

* Register an intent to retrieve account information by creating an "account access consent". This registers the data "permissions", expiration and historical period allowed for transactions/statements - that the customer (PSU) has consented to provide to the AISP; and

* Subsequently, retrieve account and transaction data.
