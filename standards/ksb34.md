**Can AISPs change the permission language?**

The AISP must ensure they have business rules that manage the relationship between data clusters and product type. They must omit access to data clusters that are irrelevant to a product type, as well as their service offering. If an AISP requests a cluster of data that is irrelevant to the product type associated with the payment account e.g. Direct Debit cluster requested for a Savings Account product type, the ASPSP may provide that cluster as empty.
