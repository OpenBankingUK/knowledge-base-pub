**Is it possible to amend or revoke a standing order (SO) or scheduled payment (FDP)?**

If a PSU has given consent to a PISP to initiate a SO or FDP, then the SO and FDP cannot be amended or cancelled via a PISP directly following payment initiation. However, it is expected that customers should be able to amend or cancel a SO or FDP in the domain of their ASPSP, provided that this functionality is available in the direct online channels.
