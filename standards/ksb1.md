**What are Open Data API specifications?**

The Open Data API specifications allow API providers (e.g. banks, building societies, and ATM providers) to develop API endpoints which can then be accessed by API users (e.g. third-party developers) to build mobile and web applications for banking customers.

These specifications cover the following endpoints:

* ATM API.
* Branch API.
* Personal Current Account (PCA) API.
* Business Current Account (BCA) API.
* Business SME Commercial Credit Cards (CCC) API.
* Business SME Unsecured Loans (SME) API.
* Personal Current Account Service Quality Metrics.
* Business Current Account Service Quality Metrics.
