**Is there a list of all ASPSPs participating in the Open Banking Ecosystem?**

Together with UK Finance and FDATA, OBIE has developed and maintains a list of ASPSPs here: <a href="https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/1145209627/Transparency+Calendar/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Transparency Calendar</a>

This shows key information including: contact details, which directory is being used, and a link to a page maintained by each ASPSP showing further details of the APIs being implemented by each. While this list does not guarantee to include all UK ASPSPs, it is intended to be as comprehensive as possible.
