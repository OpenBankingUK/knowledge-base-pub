**Can ASPSPs create their own enumeration when required?**

Yes, ASPSPs can create their own enumerations.

The OBIE Specification includes various fields of Enumerated data types, where either the values are fixed to an OBIE defined set of alternatives (i.e. Static Enumerations), or flexible with an initial OBIE defined set of alternatives, and ASPSPs can use/extend these alternatives (i.e. Namespaced Enumerations).
