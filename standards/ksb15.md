 **What is the Event Notification API?** 

The Event Notification API Profile describes the flows and common functionality to allow a TPP to receive event notifications.

This covers a number of use cases, including:

* Updates to the status of a payment initiation (e.g. when there are multiple authorisations required in the ASPSP interface).
* Revocation of AISP access by the PSU in the ASPSP interface.
