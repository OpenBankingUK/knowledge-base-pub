**What types and lengths of account identification are supported?**

UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber is specific to UK. The SchemeName field is namespaced, meaning the ASPSP/PISP may use a different scheme name, if it is not already defined in OBIE specifications.

The identification field is 256 characters long so you can add more than 14 characters if required.
