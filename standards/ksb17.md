 **Are there separate swagger specifications for Real-time (push) notifications and aggregated polling?** 

Event Subscription, CallbackURLregistration and Aggregated Polling specifications are all hosted by the ASPSP, while the TPP hosts the endpoint to receivereal-time push notifications.

As of v3.1.3, there are four Swagger specification files, one for each Events Resource:
