**Are "File Payments" supported in the Standard for both personal and business accounts?**

File Payments allow a file of payment requests to be uploaded to an ASPSP for payment initiation. Implementation of this endpoint is 'Conditional' which means the ASPSP must implement if the same functionality is supported for their PSUs (which could be for Business and/or Personal accounts) on their existing online channels.
