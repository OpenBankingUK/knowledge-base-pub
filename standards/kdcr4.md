**Does the DCR specification support ASPSPs who do not accept OBIE issued SSAs?**

The DCR specification provides the extensibility to use an SSA from any trust anchor (not just the Open Banking Directory). However, the specification does not define these extension points. It is up to each ASPSP or Trust Anchor to define how other SSAs should be used in this case.
