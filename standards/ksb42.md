**When a TPP calls the Party or Parties endpoint, will they always receive the PartyType attribute?**

It is optional for the ASPSPs to provide the PartyType field as part of the Party or Parties endpoint. 

ASPSPs **must** make documentation available to TPPs (e.g. on their developer portals) which should specify which 'Conditional' / 'Optional' endpoints and fields have been implemented.
