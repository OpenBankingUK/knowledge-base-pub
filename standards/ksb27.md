**What are the implementation timelines for a newly published specification or guidelines?** 

Please refer to the Operational Guidelines: <a href="https://standards.openbanking.org.uk/operational-guidelines/change-and-communication-management/implementation-of-a-new-obie-standard/latest/" class="external-link"Â rel="nofollow">Implementation of a new OBIE Standard</a>

* It is up to ASPSPs to take their own position of which version of each component of the Standard they chose to implement in order to meet both regulatory and commercial requirements. 
* OBIE recommends that where an ASPSP chooses to implement a new version of any component of the Standard, they should implement each new major version within six months, and each new minor version within three months of the Standard being published by OBIE.

ASPSPs should provide notification of any changes to TPPs at least three months prior to those changes taking effect.
