**What Resource URI Path Structure should be used while implementing the Read/Write API Specification v3.1.2?**

If implementing Version 3.1.2, the major version is 3 and the minor version is 1. The last .2 indicates a patch release and must not be present in the URI path. In this case, the implementer must define the resource URI path as 3.1.
