**Does an ASPSP need to delete Client related consents once TPP has deleted Client?**

This relates to client registration that the TPP does with each ASPSP.

The OBIE Standard is silent on Client registration and De-registration. It is up to ASPSPs to decide their approach in alignment with FAPI and OpenId Connect.
