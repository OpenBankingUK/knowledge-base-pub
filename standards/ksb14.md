**Are there different signing policies for Event Notifications?**

The signing policy for any resource isn't dependent on the Swagger File. It is up to the ASPSP's implementation of the Events resource, e.g. <a href="https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.3/profiles/event-notification-api-profile.html#event-notification-message-signing" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Event Notification Message Signing</a> and is similar to any other Read/Write API specification, other than the JWT's signature (JWS) which is sent in the HTTP body of the request, as opposed to a detached JWS sent in the HTTP header.
