**How can the ASPSP inform the AISP that access has been revoked?**

The OB solution supports the revocation of consent at the TPP dashboard and the revocation of access at the ASPSP dashboard.
When access is revoked at the ASPSP access dashboard by the PSU, the TPP can be notified as follows:-
* Real-time/ Push Notifications: The functionality enables ASPSPs to notify AISPs in real-time (i.e. immediately) when a PSU revokes their access at their ASPSP dashboard or other account access changes events take place.
* Aggregated polling / Pull Notifications: This enables the provision of notification of revocations from ASPSPs to AISPs, upon AISP request. It allows an AISP to request an aggregated set of access revocations and other account access events related to multiple access consents from multiple PSUs during a specific period.
