**How to I validate and trust the Conformance Tool image I'm downloading?**

Docker Content Trust (DCT) allows Open Banking to sign docker images before they get published to the Docker Hub registry. These signatures allow client-side or runtime verification of the integrity and publisher of specific image tags.

You can find full details on how to validate [here](https://bitbucket.org/openbankingteam/conformance-suite/src/develop/docs/docker_content_trust.md)
