**Why does an ASPSP need to provide Functional Conformance?**

An ASPSP may use the Functional Conformance tool as a means of providing evidence to their competent authority that their PSD2 interfaces are based on an open and widely accepted standard. The competent authority may take this into consideration while processing the ASPSP's application for an exemption to provide a fallback interface.
