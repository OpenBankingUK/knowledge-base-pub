## **New SCA (Art 10A and Art 36(6) changes**

### **While the new SCA regulation comes in force on 26 March 2022, will implementation timeframes differ amongst ASPSPs? **

Yes, while the regulatory change comes into force on 26 March 2022, the implementation timeframes will differ amongst ASPSPs. We note that the FCA is encouraging the use of the exemption by ASPSPs as soon as possible after the 26 March 2022 with widespread adoption by 30 September 2022.  We will encourage the use of the transparency calendar so ASPSPs can post their implementation dates, which should assist with providing clarity in this regard. We have also included a link 

### **If ASPSPs are not ready, will the PSUs still need to re-authenticate (SCA) every 90 days?**

We anticipate that there may be journeys that require reauthentication past 26 March 2022 until the ASPSP is ready with the change.

### **Can PSU reconfirm access to the account directly with the ASPSP?**

No, when the regulatory change comes into force on 26 March 2022, the PSU will only have to reconfirm their consent to the AISP every 90 days provided the consent has not expired.

### **Does AISP need to inform the ASPSP that PSU has reconfirmed consent?**

No, when the regulatory change comes into force on 26 March 2022, the AISP will be responsible for reconfirming consent and will not have to communicate this with the ASPSP.

### **Can the AISP access the PSUs account details like balance etc if the PSU has not reconfirmed consent in the past 90 days?**

No, the AISP can only continue to access the PSUs account details if the PSU has reconfirmed their consent in the past 90 days.

### **Can the AISP access PSUs transaction details for more than 90 days worth of transactions?**

In order to access more than 90 days' worth of transactions, the PSU will need to re-authenticate (SCA) at the ASPSP.
