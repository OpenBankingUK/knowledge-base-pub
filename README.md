# Knowledge Base

## Overview

Welcome to the open source **Knowledge Base for Open Banking**. This repository contains the markdown files *(with the .MD extension)* used across Open Banking and all the associated services. If you want to use markdown files then you don't need to run this code, we offer a hosted version of the app at [INSERT OB LINK TO CONFLUENCE]. If you'd like to host your own copy of Knowledge Base or contribute, then this is the place for you.
